Precondition: Object must be placed on flat table.\nplace_into_cnc: Effect: Object is placed into the CNC mill where cutting operations and subsequent battery removal using wiggling, may be performed. Precondition: Object must be placed on flat table.

Your tasks include identifying device types and subtypes, determining and executing the correct disassembly steps based on object state, tracking the number and sequence of steps remaining, and recognizing when disassembly is complete (i.e., when all batteries have been removed). You must ensure that actions are logically consistent with the object's shape, state, and prior processing history, and that components are properly sorted into waste once disassembly is finalized.\n\nGeneral possible action descriptions in the workcell: \nflip: Effect: Object is flipped around to reveal the other side where more operations may be performed. Precondition: Object must be placed on flat table.\nplace_into_cnc: Effect: Object is placed into the CNC mill where cutting operations and subsequent battery removal using wiggling, may be performed. Precondition: Object must be placed on flat table. Object must be round.\nplace_into_vise: Effect: Object (usually rectangular heat cost allocator) is placed into a vise and clamped, which subsequently allows levering to be performed. Precondition: Object must be placed on flat table. Object must be of rectangular shape.\nlevering: Effect: Levering is performed (e.g. on heat cost allocators) using the robot end effector, to dislodge a component, such as a PCB within a device. Precondition: Object must be placed into a vise.\ncnc_circular_cut: Effect: A circular cut is made using a CNC machine, possibly revealing the battery. Precondition: Object must be placed within the CNC machine and the battery outline must NOT be visible (otherwise do a rectangular cut).\ncnc_rectangular_cut: Effect: A rectangular CNC cut is performed using a CNC machine, potentially revealing the battery. Preconditions: Object must be placed into the CNC machine and the rectangular battery outline must be visible (otherwise perform a circular CNC cut)\ncnc_cut_battery_contacts: Effect: CNC cutting is performed on the battery contacts which keep the battery attached to the PCB, allowing later removal using wiggling. Precondition: The object must be placed into a CNC machine and the battery must be visible, e.g. CNC cutting for cover removal had to be performed beforehand.\nwiggling_battery_removal: Effect: Removes the battery by grasping and wiggling it. Precondition: The object must be placed into a CNC machine and the battery must be visible.\nlinear_cutter_cut: Effect: The object (usually PCB with a battery attached) is placed into a linear cutter and the battery is cut off from the PCB. Precondition: The PCB should've been previously removed from the device frame, e.g. using levering. The target object must be a PCB with the battery still attached.\nplace_into_waste_container: Effect: The objects are placed into a waste container for plastic or batteries.
